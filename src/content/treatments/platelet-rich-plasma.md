PRP is the latest hair and skin rejuvenation technology that uses your bodyâ€™s own cells to rejuvenate the hair, skin. Platelets release growth factors that aid the body to repair itself by stimulating cells to regenerate new tissues. This can be used to rejuvenate the face, including reducing fine-lines caused by sun damage. The treatment is versatile and can be applied across the body and face. It is very safe because your very own plasma is used. At 99 Medispa we offer Factor 4, Swiss Tube and Scalp Care PRP!
