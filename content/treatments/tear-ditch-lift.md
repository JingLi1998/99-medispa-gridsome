Tear troughs are the grooves that sit between the lower eyelid and the cheeks. In many cases, tear troughs are genetic rather than a result of ageing. Tear troughs can be corrected by injecting dermal filler directly under the hollow between the lower eyelid and cheek. This lifts the tear trough up to the level of the lower eyelid and cheek, thus smoothing the appearance of the area. Fillers placed in this area often last for many years.
