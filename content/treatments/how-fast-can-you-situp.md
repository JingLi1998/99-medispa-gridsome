Emsculpt utilises high-intensity focused electromagnetic energy to force involuntary contraction of the target muscle, allowing to overload and work the muscle faster than the human brain can achieve. In doing so it is able  to deliver the equivalent of 20,000 situps or squats in a single 30 minute session!
