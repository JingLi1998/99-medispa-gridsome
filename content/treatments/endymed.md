EndyMed is a cosmetic-care system based on pain-free thermal energy. The technology is FDA-certified and equipped with unique features. It's superior to other technologies as it is equipped with resistive sensors, motion sensors and thermal sensors for better treatment. It also uses 3Deep monochrome frequency (RF) technology, which helps make the skin firmer, reduce the appearance of wrinkles and cellulite, and stimulate natural collagen production. Combined, it aids skin resurfacing, heals scarring, provides immediate improvement and produces long-term results with only a short duration of treatment.
