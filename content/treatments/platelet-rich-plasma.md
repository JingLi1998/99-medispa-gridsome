Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) is the latest medical hair and skin rejuvenation technology that uses your body’s own cells to rejuvenate the hair, skin and slow down aging. Platelets release growth factors that aid the body to repair itself by stimulating cells to regenerate new tissues. PRP can be used to rejuvenate the face, including reducing fine lines caused by sun damage. Common areas treated with PRP include the eyes, cheeks, neck, décolletage and hands. It can also work on the skin around the knees, elbows and abdomen. It is a safe because your very own plasma is used. At 99 Medispa we offer Factor 4, Swiss Tube and Scalp Care PRP!
