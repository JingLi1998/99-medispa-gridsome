Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) is the latest medical hair and skin rejuvenation technology that uses your body’s own cells to rejuvenate the hair, skin and slow down the ageing process. As well as assisting blood clotting, platelets also release growth factors that assist the human body to repair itself by stimulating cells to regenerate new tissues.

PRP can be used to rejuvenate the face, including improving fine-to-moderate wrinkles caused by sun damage. The most common areas treated with PRP include around the eyes, the cheeks, the neck, décolletage and the back of the hands. It can also be used on other areas of the body such as on the skin around the knees, elbows and abdomen. It is a safe treatment because your very own plasma is used. Here at 99 Medispa we offer Factor 4, Swiss Tube and Scalp Care PRP.
