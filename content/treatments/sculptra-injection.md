Sculptra is an injectable cosmetic filler that can be used to restore facial volume lost due to aging or illness. It contains poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), a biocompatible synthetic substance that stimulates collagen production. It can be used to treat deep lines, creases, and folds to give a more youthful appearance.
