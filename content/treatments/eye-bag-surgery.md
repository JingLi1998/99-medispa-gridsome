Eye bag surgery, also called blepharoplasty of the lower eyelid, is a cosmetic procedure that helps correct lose skin, excess fat, and wrinkles of the lower eye area. As you age, your skin naturally loses elasticity and fat padding. This can make the lower eyelid appear puffy, wrinkled, and baggy. Lower eyelid surgery can make the undereye smoother, creating a more youthful look.
