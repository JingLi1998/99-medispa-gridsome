Emsculpt is a new revolutionary body contouring treatment. Unlike alternative fat-freezing treatments, this new technology achieves contouring by simultaneously building muscle whilst also building fat. It can be applied all across the body, targetting major muscle groups such as the abdominals, arms, butt and calves.
